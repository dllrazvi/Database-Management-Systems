# Database Management Systems â€“ Advanced SQL and Database Logic

This repository contains my coursework for the **Database Management Systems** subject, which is a continuation of the foundation built in the [Databases](https://github.com/dllrazvi/Databases) repository. While the Databases course focused on relational modeling and basic SQL queries, this course moved towards more advanced database management tasks and automation techniques.

## Course Overview

The course covered advanced topics in SQL programming and database logic, with a focus on practical implementations using **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)** and **Visual Paradigm** for database modeling.

## Topics Covered

### Advanced Querying Techniques
- Complex queries using multiple `JOIN` types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Nested subqueries and correlated subqueries
- Conditional operators such as `EXISTS`, `ANY`, `ALL`
- Grouping and filtering data using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`

### Views
- Creating and managing views for simplifying complex queries
- Using views to enhance code reusability and security

### Stored Procedures
- Writing parameterized stored procedures to encapsulate business logic
- Reducing code duplication with modular procedure calls

### Triggers
- Implementing database triggers for automatic responses to `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE` events
- Enforcing data integrity through automated constraints

### Transactions and Error Handling
- Managing data consistency with `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `ROLLBACK`, and `COMMIT`
- Handling errors inside stored procedures using `TRY...CATCH` blocks

### Indexing and Optimization
- Using indexes to optimize query performance
- Basic analysis of execution plans

### Data Modeling
- Using Visual Paradigm to design relational diagrams
- Translating diagrams into functional SQL schemas

## Practical Highlights

Throughout this course, I worked on several practical exercises involving:
- Designing complex database schemas
- Writing optimized queries for data retrieval
- Automating tasks through procedures and triggers
- Managing transaction control and data consistency
- Structuring SQL code in a modular and professional way

## Summary

This repository reflects my progression from basic database operations to advanced SQL programming, with a focus on building maintainable, scalable, and optimized database systems. It complements the core concepts in [Databases](https://github.com/dllrazvi/Databases) and demonstrates applied knowledge suitable for real-world database applications.
